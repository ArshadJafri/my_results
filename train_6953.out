Warning: The cache directory for DeepSpeed Triton autotune, /home/axs7716/.triton/autotune, appears to be on an NFS system. While this is generally acceptable, if you experience slowdowns or hanging when DeepSpeed exits, it is recommended to set the TRITON_CACHE_DIR environment variable to a non-NFS path.

Detected VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 but ignoring it because one or several of --include/--exclude/--num_gpus/--num_nodes cl args were used. If you want to use CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES don't pass any of these arguments to deepspeed.
